# Verilog Modules
## Overview
This repository offers a collection of reuable and tested Verilog modules made for quick digital design and testing for hardware development. These modules are compiled using a free and open-source compiler named **Icarus Verilog** and the waveform output of verilog code is viewed using **GTKwave**. The modules are compatible with most of the verilog IDE's like Xilinx Vivado and more.
